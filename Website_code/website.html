          I'm an adaptable collaborator with a global mindset, having worked in
          the United States, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Passionate about
          life-long learning and solving complex problems in the data and
          software space. Early in my career I focused on turning data into
          actional information for stakeholders. My responsibilities included
          building data warehouses (and data marts) from the ground up, building
          and maintaining business-critical reporting, and consulting
          stakeholders in ambiguous environments to better understand data
          trends affecting their departments. Areas of focus were analyzing
          marketing impact, logistics efficiency, and supporting wholesale
          planning. I am now pivoting my career to software engineering while
          leveraging my experience in data. Graduating in spring 2024, I want to
          focus on developing software that helps push companies products
          forward. I particularly want to work in an environment where I can
          learn from experienced engineers to develop and solidify my own
          software engineering knowledge. I am interested in software design,
          helping build a large software project from the ground up, machine
          learning, and artificial intelligence.

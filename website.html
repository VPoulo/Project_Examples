          I'm an adaptable collaborator with a global mindset, having worked in
          the United States, Germany, and the Czech Republic. Passionate about
          life-long learning and solving complex problems in the data and
          software space. Early in my career I focused on turning data into
          actional information for stakeholders. My responsibilities included
          building data warehouses (and data marts) from the ground up, building
          and maintaining business-critical reporting, and consulting
          stakeholders in ambiguous environments to better understand data
          trends affecting their departments. Areas of focus were analyzing
          marketing impact, logistics efficiency, and supporting wholesale
          planning. I am now pivoting my career to software engineering while
          leveraging my experience in data. Graduating in spring 2024, I want to
          focus on developing software that helps push companies products
          forward. I particularly want to work in an environment where I can
          learn from experienced engineers to develop and solidify my own
          software engineering knowledge. I am interested in software design,
          helping build a large software project from the ground up, machine
          learning, and artificial intelligence.

          <h3>Reservation System</h3>
          <p>Language: C++</p>
          <p>
            This project was to create a reservation system for three different
            venues. The user can create a reservation at a ski lodge, a
            restaurant, or a museum. I created a vector data type and then used
            a generic programming template for the doubely linked list and array
            data types. The goal of this assignment was to practice using the
            generic template library, operator overloading (l-value v. r-value),
            exception handling, as well as constructors. Check out the code for
            more details.

          <h3>Gradebook</h3>
          <p>Language: Python</p>
          <p>
            This project was to create a gradebook for a teacher to use. The
            user is prompted to enter the grades for different students. The
            teacher enters grades for specific assignments for each student. The
            teacher can then look-up individual students grades by name and see
            who is passing the class. All students can be listed and grades can
            be updated. The data structure for this project is a binary search
            tree. Click below to see more information.

          <h3>B-Tree (2-3 Tree)</h3>
          <p>Language: C++</p>
          <p>
            This project was primarily to practice a complex tree data
            structure. Additional learning goals were to use smart pointers and
            practice inheritance. In this program, the user can enter different
            concepts and add them to a repository. The concepts are then stored
            in a 2-3 tree data structure. The 2-3 tree is always essentially
            balanced and therefore has great search run-time. This one of the
            most complex data structures I have programmed. To check out the
            program, click the link below.

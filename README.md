CS563: Intro to Web Development
Term: Winter Term 2023

This website was built as a project for CS563: Intro to Web Development. The assignment was to make a professional website about ourselves, which included different elements (such as a navbar, an about me section, etc). This website is the final project in the course to get students to put their learned knowledge together and make something independently. The website was built to be accessible to those with disabilities (high contrast colors, using alt tags, proper heading notations, etc).

The code linked on the site (and in the repo) can be run in any linux envronment.
To run the code:

1. Compile the code using gcc \*.c
2. Run the code using ./a.out.

The programs listed on the site are all programs I wrote myself in CS302: Programming Systems. The programs were designed and written within 2 weeks, each one practicing a different topic learned in class.

This website was builting using course lecture resources, as well as the following outside sources:

1. W3School - How to Mobile Navigation (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp)
2. Stackoverflow - Trouble shooting Mobile Navigation Interaction (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66376887/why-isnt-my-nav-bar-resetting-after-i-click-the-burger-and-expand-the-window)

This website is deployed on GitHub Pages.
